## Missing Persons Trend and Possibilities of Human Trafficking in West Bengal (2024–2025)

---

### 📍 Overview

West Bengal has witnessed a disturbing rise in missing persons cases over recent years, with the numbers continuing to increase through 2024 and into the first eight months of 2025. Given the state’s historical role as a hub for human trafficking—especially involving women and children—the rising missing persons trend carries a high possibility of being directly linked to trafficking networks. This report analyzes available data, identifies systemic vulnerabilities, and presents logical inferences indicating that human trafficking is a major driver behind the growing number of untraced missing persons.

### 📊 Data Summary

- **Year-on-Year Growth**: Missing persons rose from 5,172 in 2020 to 7,378 in 2023.

### 🔗 Correlation Between Missing Persons and Human Trafficking

- **Trafficking Epicenter**: West Bengal has long been identified as one of India’s major human trafficking hubs. Districts like South & North 24 Parganas, Murshidabad, Nadia, and Malda repeatedly emerge as hotspots.  
- **Children at Risk**: The state has accounted for over 20% of India’s missing children in some years, many of whom remain untraced—strongly suggesting trafficking involvement.  
- **Untraced ≈ Trafficked**: The disproportionately high share of untraced persons overlaps significantly with known trafficking footprints, indicating that a large section of the missing are being absorbed into trafficking networks.

#### 🚨 Traffickers’ Methods

- Luring victims through false job offers, marriage proposals, or migration promises  
- Exploiting poverty, porous international borders, and weak inter-state enforcement  
- Using forged documents, forced marriages, and cross-border routes to avoid detection

#### ⚠️ Systemic Gaps

- Many trafficking cases are underreported or misclassified as missing persons  
- Low conviction rates and lengthy trials discourage survivors from seeking justice  
- Law enforcement’s fragmented coordination enables organized networks to operate with impunity

### 🧾 Case Illustrations

- **2025 CBI Rescue**: A girl missing from West Bengal was found trafficked to Rajasthan, where she had been sold twice for marriage using forged documents.  
- **Documented NGO Reports**: Children and women from vulnerable communities in West Bengal are repeatedly trafficked for domestic work, forced marriage, and sexual exploitation, proving that missing cases often mask systematic trafficking crimes.

### 🧭 Conclusion

The surge in missing persons in West Bengal during 2024–2025 cannot be dismissed as a random social pattern. The available data, district-level patterns, confirmed rescue cases, and systemic vulnerabilities make it clear that:

- The possibility of human trafficking behind missing persons cases in West Bengal is very high.  
- Untraced missing persons are not just “unfound” individuals; many are absorbed into trafficking networks that exploit poverty, porous borders, and institutional gaps.  
- This makes trafficking not a peripheral but a central explanatory factor behind the state’s missing persons crisis.

### 📝 Observation

The rising number of missing persons in West Bengal strongly aligns with human trafficking activities. Trafficking is highly likely to be the key driver behind the surge in untraced missing individuals.
